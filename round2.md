### Key Observations:
1. **Total Query Performance:**  
   - PostgreSQL is **slightly faster** (1,806 ms vs. 1,880 ms).  

2. **Short-Term Queries (1 to 30 days):**  
   - **MongoDB is consistently faster**, taking around **2,500-2,700 ms**.  
   - PostgreSQL is **significantly slower** for shorter time frames (**7,000+ ms for most queries**).  

3. **Long-Term Queries (180-360 days):**  
   - MongoDB remains **stable (~2,700 ms)** across large periods.  
   - PostgreSQL **performs better for long-term queries** than short-term but is still **almost twice as slow as MongoDB** (5,200-5,700 ms).  

### Conclusion:
- **MongoDB dominates in short-term and long-term queries** with more consistent performance.  
- **PostgreSQL struggles with short-term queries** but is **competitive for full dataset counts**.
