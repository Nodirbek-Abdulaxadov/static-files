**Notes:**

- **Performance** Assessed based on request handling efficiency and throughpu
- **Syntax Complexity** Evaluated based on learning curve and code verbosit
- **Scalability** Determined by the framework's ability to handle over 100,000 requests per second, considering factors like concurrency models and architectur

**Key Observations:**

- **High Scalability** Frameworks like **Gin (Go)**, **Axum (Rust)**, and **Spring Boot (Java)** are designed for high concurrency and can efficiently handle over 100k requests per secon
- **Moderate Scalability** Frameworks such as **ASP.NET Core (C#)** and **Fastify (JavaScript)** can achieve high scalability with proper optimization and load balancin.
